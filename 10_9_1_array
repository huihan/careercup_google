You are at a political convention with n delegates, each one a member of exactly one political 
party. It is impossible to tell which political party any delegate belongs to; in particular, you will 
be summarily ejected from the convention if you ask. However, you can determine whether any 
two delegates belong to the same party or not by introducing them to each otherâ€”members of the 
same party always greet each other with smiles and friendly handshakes; members of different 
parties always greet each other with angry stares and insults. 
(a) Suppose a majority (more than half) of the delegates are from the same political party. 
Describe an efficient algorithm that identifies a member (anymember) of the majority party.
