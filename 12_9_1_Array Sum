You have a circular track containing fuel pits at irregular intervals.
The total amount of fuel available from all the pits together is just sufficient to travel round the 
track and finish where you started. Given the the circuit perimeter, list of each fuel pit location
and the amount of fuel they contain, 
find the optimal start point on the track such that you never run out of fuel and complete circuit.
