First greater number in an array. Given a large array of positive 
integers, for an arbitrary integer A, we want to know the first integer in 
the array which is greater than or equal A . O(logn) solution required 
ex [2, 10,5,6,80] 
input : 6 output : 10 
input :20 output : 80

I think the question should be: you can do a pre-process, and after than, every search time is O(log n). 

My solution is remove some un-usefull value (2,3,1,6,5,4) = > (2,3,,6,,) , because 1< 3, and 5,4<6. and then put the rest value in a binary search tree with their order number. 

After the pre-process, the following search should be O(log n).
