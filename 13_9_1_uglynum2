Print the numbers of form 2^i.5^j in increasing order. For eg: 
1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20
Compute_Increasing_Order() { 
arr[0]= 1 
count_2 = 0 
count_5 = 0 
for(int i = 0; ; i++) 
{ 
if(2 * arr[count_2] <= 5 * arr[count_5]) 
{ 
arr[i] = 2 * arr[count_2]; 
count_2 ++; 
} else { 
arr[i] = 5 * arr[count_5]; 
count_5 ++; 
} 
print arr[i]; 
i++; 
} 
}
