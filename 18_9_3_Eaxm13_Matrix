Given an N x M matrix having only positive values, we have to nullify the matrix i.e make all entries 0. 
We are given two operations 
1) multiply each element of any one column at a time by 2. 
2) Subtract 1 from all elements of any one row at a time 

Find the minimum number of operations required to nullify the matrix. 
Note: no range of input was given

key to solve this problem: 
i) do NOT use operation 2(O2) on any row that has "1" in it till all the member in that row is "1". 
ii) use operation 1(O1) on any col that has "1" in it and then O2 to prevent case one from happening. 

algorithm to solve it: 
s1)search for the minimum value in row i, let it be a. Record all index where a occur; 
s2)do O2 for (a-1) times to row i; 
s3)check if any column has a value greater than "1" 
true: 
s4)do O1 for each column indexed in step 1(s1). go to s1 
false: 
s5)do O2 then move to next row(i++) 

for example of a row: 
s1: 4 17 11 
s2: 1 14 8 
s3->4: 2 14 8 
s1~2:	1 13 7 
s3->4: 2 13 7 
s1~2:	1 12 6 
s3->4: 2 12 6

s1~2:	1 7 1 
s3->4: 2 7 2 
s1~2:	1 6 1 
s3->4: 2 6 2

s1~2:	1 2 1 
s3->4: 2 2 2 
s1~2:	1 1 1 
s3->5: 0 0 0
